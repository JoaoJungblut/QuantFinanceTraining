These intellectual masters of humour were predominantly Oxbridge graduates.

It is intended for those who are new to  programming in Python. As well as an informal lecture style delivery we will also be doing exercises. We don’t want to be computer scientists or developers. Our goal is solve pricing problems numerically; handle/analyse data and plot data, using Python – simple and enjoyable! Where possible we use as much of the built-in functionality as possible – remember this is not a computer science course.

    "There are no type declarations of variables, parameters, functions, or methods in source code. This makes the code short; well structured; readable and flexible, and one loses the compile-time type checking of the source code. The philosophy is “we code what we think”. Python tracks the types of all values at runtime and flags code that does not make sense as it runs. An excellent way to see how Python code works is to run the Python interpreter and type code right into it. \n",

    "Science has traditionally consisted of two major disciplines, theory and experimentation. In the last several decades a third important and exciting component has emerged, i.e. scientific computing. Scientific computing acts as an intersection of the former two areas of science. It is often closely related to theory, but it also has many characteristics in common with experimental work. It is therefore often viewed as a third branch of science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most areas of science, computation is an invaluable complement to both experiments and theory. Vast majority of both experimental and theoretical research involve some numerical calculations, simulations or computer modelling. In many studies, pure theory alone is insufficient in validating or demonstrating results. On the other hand, experimentation as a sole means of conducting an investigation may lack the scientific rigour necessary to hold up to scrutiny. Experimental work may not be possible or may prove too costly. \n"

    "## Preliminary Remarks about Program Style\n",
    "**Whitespace** is the name given to spaces, tabs and indents. Whitespace is also used to define blocks (in C++) using indentation. This promotes readability. For certain code it is necessary, and we will discuss later in the section on user-defined functions.The end of a line is unimportant in Python, as it almost completely ignores whitespace. The compounding formula script above was expressed in two ways and both gave the same result. However the lack of program comments, spaces, new lines and indentation makes this program quite unacceptable, and with larger programs becomes very difficult to read. Whilst there is much more to developing a good programming style than learning to lay out programs properly, this is nevertheless a good start. \n",
    "Be consistent with your program layout, and make sure the indentation and spacing reflects the logical structure of your program.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a good idea to choose meaningful names for variables. Remember that your code might need modification by other programmers at a later date. Even if a programmer refers to their own code (say) a year later, without proper documentation and use of meaningful variable names, they will need to spend considerable time refreshing them self on the various parts of the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike some languages, whitespace is significant in Python.  In Python a block is delimited by indentation. There's no brackets or parentheses to match up just indents. "
